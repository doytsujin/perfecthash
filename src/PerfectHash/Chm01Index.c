Module Name:

    Chm01Index.c

Abstract:

    This module implements the Index() routine for the CHM v1 algorithm, as well
    as custom FastIndex() routines for certain combinations of hash function and
    masking type.

PerfectHashTableIndexImplChm01(
    PPERFECT_HASH_TABLE Table,
    ULONG Key,

    )
/*++

Routine Description:

    Looks up given key in a perfect hash table and returns its index.

    N.B. If Key did not appear in the original set the hash table was created
         from, the behavior of this routine is undefined.  (In practice, the
         key will hash to either an existing key's location or an empty slot,
         so there is potential for returning a non-unique index.)

Arguments:

    Table - Supplies a pointer to the table for which the key lookup is to be
        performed.

    Key - Supplies the key to look up.

    Index - Receives the index associated with this key.  The index will be
        between 0 and Table->HashSize-1, and can be safely used to offset
        directly into an appropriately sized array (e.g. Table->Values[]).

Return Value:

    S_OK on success, E_FAIL if the underlying hash function returned a failure.
    This will happen if the two hash values for a key happen to be identical.
    It shouldn't happen once a perfect graph has been created (i.e. it only
    happens when attempting to solve the graph).  The Index parameter will
    be cleared in the case of E_FAIL.
